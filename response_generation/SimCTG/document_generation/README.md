#### 3. Inference with SimCTG
Here we show how to use SimCTG to perform inference with prefixes from validation and test sets.
```yaml
chmod +x ./inference.sh
./inference.sh
```
The arguments are as follows:
* `--ckpt_path`: The path of trained checkpoint. You can either use our released checkpoint (`cambridgeltl/simctg_wikitext103`) or your own trained model that can be found in the `--save_path_prefix` directory as defined in train.sh.

* `--k`: The k in contrastive search.
* `--alpha`: The \alpha in contrastive search.
* `--save_path`: Where to save the generated result.

The generated file is a list of dictionary, where the data format of each dictionary is:

```yaml
{  
   "prefix_text": The human-written prefix.
   "reference_text": The reference document (prefix + reference text continuation).
   "reference_continuation_text": The reference text continuation.   
   "generated_result": {
       "0": {
           "full_text": The prefix + generated continuation.
           "continuation": The generated continuation.
            }
       }

```

**[Note]** We provide our generated file in ./simctg_contrasive.json.

#### 4. Generate Result with Different Decoding Methods:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_zPZRlbJo5iw_Q7FUhP113udPnciUxVF?usp=sharing)

Here, we use the prefix in Table 4 of our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06417) to illustrate how to use different decoding methods to generate the result. 
```python
import torch
from simctg import SimCTG
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
# load model and tokenizer
model_path = r'cambridgeltl/simctg_wikitext103'
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = SimCTG(model_path, tokenizer.pad_token_id)
model.eval()

# prepare prefix input
text = r"Butt criticized Donald 's controls in certain situations in the game , as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles . Buchanan also criticized the controls , calling"
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
input_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)
input_ids = torch.LongTensor(input_ids).view(1,-1)
```
<span id='contrastive_search'/>

##### 4.1. Contrastive Search:
```python
# use contrastive search to generate the result
beam_width, alpha, decoding_len = 8, 0.6, 128
output = model.fast_contrastive_search(input_ids, beam_width, alpha, decoding_len)
#output = model.slow_contrastive_search(input_ids, beam_width, alpha, decoding_len)
print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')
print(tokenizer.decode(output))

'''
   Butt criticized Donald's controls in certain situations in the game, as well as 
   the difficulty of some levels and puzzles. Buchanan also criticized the controls, 
   calling them " unimpressive " and a " nightmare " of an experience to play with 
   players unfamiliar with Tetris. On the other hand, his opinion was shared by other 
   reviewers, and some were critical of the game's technical design for the Wii version 
   of Tetris. In addition, Tintin's review included a quote from Roger Ebert, who said 
   that Tetris was better than the original game due to its simplicity and ease of play. 
   Ebert's comments were included in the game's DVD commentary, released on March 22, 2010. 
   It is unclear if any of the video commentary was taken from the DVD
'''

```
The arguments are as follows:
* `--input_ids`: The ids of the prefix sequence.
* `--beam_width`: k in the contrastive search, which is typically set within the range of [3,10].
* `--alpha`: alpha in the contrastive search, which is typically set within the range of [0.5,0.8].
* `--decoding_len`: Number of tokens to generate.

**[Note]** We provide two implementations of contrastive search: (1) fast_contrastive_search and (2) slow_contrastive_search. These two implementations produce the same result, but the fast version is properly optimized and is much faster than the slow version. On the other hand, the implementation details of the slow version is more straightforward. We recommend you to rewrite the slow version first if you want to adapt contrastive search to your specific research task.

<span id='diverse_contrastive_search'/>

##### 4.2. Diverse Contrastive Search:
We also provide a stochastic version of contrastive search which can generate diverse results by combining nucleus sampling and contrastive search. More details can be found in Appendix G of the [paper]().
```python
# use diverse contrastive search to generate the result
sample_step, nucleus_p = 2, 0.95
beam_width, alpha, decoding_len = 8, 0.6, 128
output = model.diverse_contrastive_search(input_ids, sample_step, nucleus_p, beam_width, alpha, decoding_len)
print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')
print(tokenizer.decode(output))
```
The arguments are as follows:
* `--input_ids`: The ids of the prefix sequence.
* `--sample_step`: The number of tokens sampled with nucleus sampling at the start of the generation process.
* `--nucleus_p`: The probability p in nucleus sampling.
* `--beam_width`: k in the contrastive search, which is typically set within the range of [3,10].
* `--alpha`: alpha in the contrastive search, which is typically set within the range of [0.5,0.8].
* `--decoding_len`: The total number of tokens to generate. It equals to the number of sampled tokens + the number of tokens generated by contrastive search.

##### 4.3. Nucleus Sampling:

nucleus_p, decoding_len = 0.95, 128
output = model.nucleus_sampling(input_ids, nucleus_p, decoding_len)

print(tokenizer.decode(output))
```
The arguments are as follows:
* `--input_ids`: The ids of the prefix sequence.

print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')
print(tokenizer.decode(output))
```
The arguments are as follows:
* `--input_ids`: The ids of the prefix sequence.
* `--decoding_len`: Number of tokens to generate.

<span id='beam_search'/>

##### 4.5. Beam Search:

print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')
print(tokenizer.decode(output))
```
The arguments are as follows:
* `--input_ids`: The ids of the prefix sequence.

#### 5. Visualize the Token Similarity Matrix
Here, we show how to reproduce the token similarity matrix visualization (Figure 6 of the paper).
```python
import torch
from simctg import SimCTG
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
# load model and tokenizer
model_path = r'cambridgeltl/simctg_wikitext103'
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = SimCTG(model_path, tokenizer.pad_token_id)
model.eval()

# prepare prefix input
text = r"Butt criticized Donald 's controls in certain situations in the game , as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles . Buchanan also criticized the controls , calling"
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
input_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)
input_ids = torch.LongTensor(input_ids).view(1,-1)

# use contrastive search to generate the result
beam_width, alpha, decoding_len = 8, 0.6, 128
output = model.fast_contrastive_search(input_ids, beam_width, alpha, decoding_len)

# save the visualization result
model.save_token_similarity_map(output, save_name='token_similarity_matrix_visualization.png')
```
The arguments are as follows:
* `--output`: The ids of decoded result.
* `--save_name`: The saved name of the visualization result.
